# Emotist

This program makes the phrase “emotions are contagious” come to life in a visible way. I used Scenekit to make a random grid full of blocks each with their own “feelings”. Their emotion ranges from happy (green) to sad (red) based on who is around them. Using the arrow keys the user can move around the grid and see how their emotion will effect those around them and how other will effect their character. 
While developing this program I created a grid using 2D arrays and kept track of where the users character was. I developed multiple emotion calculation algorithms, however the best one was taking a bizarre amount of time to compute, so I reverted to an arguably more realistic method.
